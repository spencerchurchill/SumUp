        <h1>Sumit Manual</h1>
        <p>Sumit will work regardless of the Aylien API; however, without the API, the extension will load iframes as previews instead of summaries.</p>
        <h2>1. Create Account</h2>
        <p>First, you need to go to <a href="https://developer.aylien.com/signup">Aylien</a> to create an account.</p>
        <h2>2. Open Dashboard</h2>
        <p>Next, activate your account (going to your email) and proceed to the <a href="https://developer.aylien.com/admin">Dashboard</a>.</p>
        <h2>3. Use App ID and API key</h2>
        <p>Under the Credentials box, note the App ID and API key. Simply input the App ID and API key into their respective input boxes in the Sumit Popup.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You are now ready to take advantage of all Sumit has to offer!</p>
        <small style="font-style: italic;">It is recommended to add "www.google.com, www.wikipedia.com, etc." to the URL Whitelist form since these websites already offer summaries.</small>
